# 🎯 PROJECT COMPLETION STATUS

**Date**: 2026-02-05
**Project**: Oxidus Knowledge Organization System
**Status**: ⚠️ Mostly complete — knowledge ingest done; LM inference unstable

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

A comprehensive **Knowledge Organization System** has been successfully designed, implemented, tested, and integrated into Oxidus. This system automatically organizes all scraped web content into an intelligent, searchable knowledge base connected to human values.

**Result**: All 366,904 characters of Wikipedia data (8 major articles) are ready to be automatically organized and used by Oxidus.

---

## 🔁 Recent Updates (2026-02-05)

- **Rebuild completed**: knowledge index rebuilt from disk — 496 texts loaded, 487 memories added.
- **Deeper extraction**: ran a deeper-extract pass; recovered 273 previously-skipped wiki/cache files to `data/knowledge_base/normalized_deeper/`.
- **QA run**: owner-mode QA and targeted summaries executed (`scripts/qa_loaded_texts.py`). System returned safe fallback replies when LM consults timed out.
- **LM Studio status**: model listing works but inference has been intermittently timing out; one fallback model returned successful HTTP 200 during retries but owner-facing dialog still falls back to the internal "I'm still thinking..." message when external inference is unavailable or empty.
- **Model pin**: default LM Studio routing is now pinned to openai/gpt-oss-20b for all response paths.
- **Health visibility**: health checks now surface expected vs active LM Studio model matching.
- **Relaunch**: Oxidus restarted after rebuild; service running under `launch_oxidus.py`.
- **Current risk**: dialog responses remain null/empty for some queries because LM Studio inference is unstable — investigate LM server logs, increase timeouts, or pin a reliable local model.

Next recommended actions:
- Inspect LM Studio server logs and/or increase request timeouts.
- Confirm /api/health reports lm_studio.model == openai/gpt-oss-20b and lm_studio.model_match == true.
- Re-run targeted LM retry with pinned working model and confirm `safe_think()` returns non-empty outputs.
- Rebuild index again if additional normalized files are moved into live `data/knowledge_base`.
